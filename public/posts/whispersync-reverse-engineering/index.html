  <p><p>I am a big fan of my Kindle. This is the device I&rsquo;d bring over to a desert
island. I am also a fairly frequent user of the highlight feature where you can
select a bit of text you like and save it. One thing is bothering me though:
the lack of open API on the Kindle to retrieve the data about me. Amazon
provides the <code>my-clippings.txt</code> file on the Kindle and the &ldquo;Export my
annotations via e-mail&rdquo; feature, but both these features cannot be done in the
background automatically, and the last read position is not available. I want
moar !</p>
<p>I want to get the raw data:</p>
<ul>
<li>to print a little book with all my annotations</li>
<li>to retrieve my last read position and see in which periods of my life I tend
to read most (reading less would be a good indicator of stressful periods)</li>
<li>to put the data in my own personal space : my <a href="https://cozy.io">cozy</a> (I work there).
I could for example randomly display favorite quotes in my Cozy-Home, or
have a &ldquo;books&rdquo; app with a public page with all my books. That would be the
digital equivalent of a bookshelf. The bookshelf as a means of sharing good
books that you’ve read is lost with the Kindle. I wish I could easily share
with my friends my reading list. goodreads.com would be another way to do
that, but I’d prefer to have the data at my disposal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The possibilities are endless&hellip; but first, I needed to get access to the
data. A long time ago, I tried to access this data via <a href="https://read.kindle.com">Kindle web</a>
but could not pass the login screen via scraping: there was if I recall
well, credential encryption on the application side, and I had not managed to
redo it correctly.</p>
<p>Recently, I have seen a presentation on using <a href="http://mitm.it/">mitmproxy</a> to discover HTTP
APIs used by apps. It gave me motivation to start again on this project:  this
time, instead of web scraping, I&rsquo;d try to understand how the Kindle
communicates with Amazon and try to emulate the same HTTP requests to access
my data.</p>
<h2 id="setup-a-man-in-the-middle-on-a-kindle-app">Setup a man in the middle on a Kindle app</h2>
<p>Disclaimer: do not attempt man-in-the-middle attacks on devices or accounts
that are not your own. To successfully conduct this project, you need to have
physical access to the device to install an SSL certificate authority.</p>
<p>To see the flow of communication between an Android device and a remote HTTP
based APIs, things are a bit more involved than from a web browser: in the web
world we have access to the network inspector which helps us record data,
replay calls, see requests and responses, etc&hellip; There is no such thing for
Android or iOS. The solution is to do a man-in-the-middle attack on our
device: proxying and recording all traffic through a controlled access point.</p>
<p>The setup is briefly described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Raspberry Pi runs as a wifi access point (through <a href="https://w1.fi/hostapd/">hostapd</a>)</li>
<li>Every packet going through the access point is redirected to mitmproxy (<a href="https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/howto-transparent/">in
the transparent mode fashion</a>)</li>
<li>HTTPs man-in-the-middle is made possible thanks to a custom CA authority
installed on the whispersync client device</li>
<li>A real or virtual (for example with <a href="https://genymotion.com">Genymotion</a>) Android 5
device</li>
<li>Kindle for Android installed on the Android device (the Play store can be
installed on Genymotion)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>ℹ️ It is also possible to use iOS but it is easier to have access to a
virtual Android device since you do not have to own a Mac</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ℹ️ On Android, it is possible to use user certificates until Android 7
Nougat. After Android 7 Nougat, apps will not use user certificates by
default. More information
<a href="https://blog.jeroenhd.nl/article/android-7-nougat-and-certificate-authorities">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is <a href="https://www.dinofizzotti.com/blog/2019-01-09-running-a-man-in-the-middle-proxy-on-a-raspberry-pi-3/">a good article to set everything
up</a>.</p>
<p>After all this setup (a bit long and tedious but not hard), it is possible
to record HTTP dumps of the traffic between the Kindle app and Amazon.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">ssh pi@192.168.50.10

mitmdump --mode transparent -w outfile
<span style="color:#75715e"># Use the Kindle app to generate traffic</span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># ctrl-c to stop the proxy</span>
exit <span style="color:#75715e">#</span>
</code></pre></div><p>At this point, <code>outfile</code> contains all the requests and responses in the
mitmproxy format.</p>
<h2 id="recording-http-dumps">Recording HTTP dumps</h2>
<p>mitmproxy uses a custom format to store dumps. It is not very interoperable:
querying and extracting data from the dumps is a bit difficult. HAR is a
standard format used for example in Chrome and Firefox (Network inspector tabs
in both browser can import/export the HAR format). The HAR format underlying
format is JSON which makes it readable and interoperable with tools like <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>
that are really handy for filtering / querying.</p>
<p>The mitmproxy repository contains a script to transform a mitmproxy
dumpfile into a HAR file.</p>
<p>To convert a mitmproxy dump into an HAR file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git clone https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy.git mitmproxy <span style="color:#75715e"># to have access to the HAR conversion script</span>

<span style="color:#75715e"># Extract the dump from the Raspberry Pi</span>

</code></pre></div><h2 id="understanding-the-flow">Understanding the flow</h2>
<p>With jq, we can extract requests URLs, which is handy to
start understanding the flow of communication between Amazon and our
device.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ cat dumps/dump.har | jq -rc <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;.log.entries | map(.request.url)&#39;</span>

</code></pre></div><h2 id="registration-and-request-signing">Registration and request signing</h2>
<p>The first call the device makes when logging in is a <code>registerDevice</code> call. It
contains both login and password and is used to register a device on Amazon.
After replaying this request through <code>curl</code>, I had a &ldquo;Wrong password&rdquo;
response. It is because Amazon sends a two factor authentication email and you
have to replay (again) the registerDevice call with the value from the two
factor authentication email in the password field to get through.</p>
<p>At this point a new device is visible on Amazon Kindle site 🙌. The next things
to do is to fetch the list of books.</p>
<p>The problem now is that we can see that every subsequent request to Amazon has
a <code>X-ADP-Request-Digest</code>: every request is &ldquo;signed&rdquo; with the help of a
certificate received in the <code>registerDevice</code> call.</p>
<p>Below, you can see an example request on the <code>syncMetadata</code> route used to get the
list of books:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Signing the request means that I needed to use the right key to sign (I was
pretty confident that the privateKey receive in the registerDevice call was the
one to use) sign the right data = find the fields from the request (and in
which order) that were used to make a fingerprint of the request</p>
<p>Fortunately, after a bit of searching I came across the repositories of
lolsborn (<a href="https://github.com/lolsborn/readsync">readsync</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lolsborn/fiona-client">fiona-client</a>) that had implementation of
request signing for the whispersync API.</p>

<p>From this bit of code, I could see which fields were used and in which order. I
now needed “only” to convert it to Javascript.</p>
<p>With the help of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-forge">node-forge</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-rsa">node-rsa</a>, after a fair bit of
struggle, I managed to have the right signature. I found it difficult even
with two example implementations to get the signature exactly right (I am not
an expert in crypto technologies and did not know both libraries, so I spent a
little bit of time trying to jam the certificate and values in every possible
ways 🙃).</p>
<p>Having a bad signature is not immediately obvious since you have to send a
request to Amazon to check it (and if it’s bad, Amazon sends an <code>Internal Server Error</code>). Using a recorded dump to have an example of the right
signature and using it in a <a href="https://jestjs.io">Jest</a> test with a fixed date (since the date is
used in the request) was very helpful as the feedback loop was very quick.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ I had to use two different libraries to get the same signature. I am
sure it is possible to use only <code>node-forge</code> though.
ℹ️ The private key is a PKCS8 certificate in DER format encoded in base64.
❓I wonder why to sign the requests, the devices do not generate
a private/public key pair and transmit the public key to Amazon: it is
a bit unusual to have something private fly on the network.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="sidecars">Sidecars</h2>
<p>After cracking the signing part, it was possible to call the <code>syncMedata</code>
route, with a proper digest header, to get all the books in our library
(yay!).</p>
<p>But, the challenge was not done yet: I was most interested in getting the
<em>metadata</em> on the book: my highlights, annotations and last page read. I
needed to find the call that was retrieving all this data.</p>
<p>When searching for the content of a highlight in the dump, I could not find
anything 🤔. When filtering the URLs of the dump with the identifier of the
book (the ASIN in Amazon parlance), some URLs looked interesting:</p>
<pre><code class="language-code" data-lang="code">https://72.21.194.248/FionaCDEServiceEngine/FSDownloadContent?type=EBOK&amp;key=&lt;MYASIN&gt;
https://54.239.26.233/FionaCDEServiceEngine/sidecar?type=EBOK&amp;key=&lt;MYASIN&gt;
</code></pre><p><code>FSDownloadContent</code> was the call to get the content of the book. But what was
the <code>sidecar</code> URL ? Sidecars sounds like something loaded to the side of the
book, maybe containing annotations ?</p>
<p>The body of the response was base64 encoded, and after a <code>base64 --decode</code>,
bingo! I could read the content of my book highlights into my terminal.</p>

<p>As you can see, the problem was that the decoded content was a bit garbled :
accents are missing and annotations are not delimited correctly. Turns out,
Amazon uses a custom binary format for its sidecars. After encryption, binary
decoding, what an adventure 🤠!</p>
<p>When searching for the sidecar application type, I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/pwr/KSP">KSP</a>
(Kindle Server Proxy), a project to connect a Calibre library to the Kindle
seamlessly. It works as a middleware between Amazon and your Kindle,
implementing routes of the Whispersync API. It serves content from your
Calibre database, or from Amazon as needed: if a book is from
Amazon, content is served from Amazon, otherwise it’s served from a local
database.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pwr/KSP">KSP</a> did not need to <em>read</em> sidebars as it was sufficient
for it to only pass the content without reading it. It did however need to
know how to <em>write</em> sidebars. The code was informative on the binary format
used, but I knew  I needed to code a sidebar parser.</p>
<h3 id="bytes-in-color">Bytes in color</h3>
<p>At this point, I decided to have a look at the bytes in a graphic form to
understand better what was going on. I had read recently about <a href="http://corte.si/posts/visualisation/binvis/index.html">visualising a binary
in color</a> so I figured I
could try to do the same thing. By reimplementing, I would have more control
onto the visualisation and hopefully it would serve when debugging the parser.</p>
<p>I fired up <a href="https://codesandbox.io">codesandbox</a> and wrote an app that when given a base64 string
would output its bytes colored based on the value of their value. I used the
HSL color space with the value of the byte controlling the hue so that nearby
valued bytes have similar colors. It is very similar to <a href="http://binvis.io/#/view/local?colors=magnitude&amp;curve=scan">cortesi&rsquo;s
binvis</a> but this one I could hack more easily to serve my needs.</p>
<figure class="figure">

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Seeing the data colored helps to see the different parts of the binary format
and find patterns. For example, here we can see at the bottom a red/green
check pattern. It is a two byte pattern, and we know that at this part, we
should have text so it is a good clue that the text is encoded in UTF16.</p>
<p>This app was really helpful when writing the parser since I could better
understand on which part the parser was struggling.</p>
<p>To write the parser, I used <a href="https://github.com/keichi/binary-parser">binary-parser</a>. Its API make it easy to make a
parser. To be able to conjugate it with the binary viewer, I monkey patched
the code to add before/after indexes to each field so that I could see each
field separately in the viewer.</p>
<p>Here is an extract from the parser:</p>

<h3 id="incredible-endia">Incredible endia</h3>
<p>To format the bytes extracted from the data section, I used the Uint{8/16}Array
APIs from the browser that serves as views on a byte buffer. This worked well
for Uint8/16 integer buffers. The problem I faced was with the string buffers :
the Uint{8/16}Array APIs work in the platform endianness (to use the native
APIs where possible). My computer was in little endian whereas the annotations
were encoded in utf16 big endian. This meant that if I wanted to read a buffer
with <code>String.fromCharCode</code> I had either to swap the endianness of the buffer or
to use a <code>DataView</code> (Javascript API to read / write data independent of the
endianness of the platform). I did not know DataView at this point so I swapped
the bytes but DataView would have worked since you can choose the endianness
when reading a value.</p>
<!-- TODO Add an example with decoding the UTF-16BE buffer without swapping
resulting in Chinese characters, and with swapping resulting in the correct
data. -->
<h3 id="data-corruption">Data corruption</h3>
<p>To test the parser, I downloaded sidecars through the whispersync client
I was building and dumped their contents in the test folder. When trying
to parse them, the parser was struggling and I could see many &ldquo;EF BF BD&rdquo; bytes
colored in blue.</p>
<figure class="figure">
    <img src="/corrupted-bytes.jpg"
         alt="Corrupted bytes visible in blue" width="300px"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Corrupted bytes visible in blue</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Those bytes were mainly present in the section of the binary containing
pointers to the annotations locations. This made the parser fail. After a
bit of struggling trying to shift the data or ignore those bytes, I searched
for &ldquo;EF BD BD&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>EF BF BD is UTF-8 for FFFD, which is the the Unicode replacement character
(used for data corruption, when characters cannot be converted to a certain
code page).
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47484039/java-charset-decode-issue-in-converting-string-to-hex-code%3E">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47484039/java-charset-decode-issue-in-converting-string-to-hex-code&gt;</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I figured out that the <code>request</code> JS library used to fetch HTTP responses
tried to decode the data as UTF-8 by default and failed (as sidecars are
transmitted as binary data over the network). Solution was to put
<code>{ encoding: null }</code> as the <code>request</code> options so that it returns
a Buffer. The buffer can then be encoded in base64 to print it to the console
with no garbled character. This base64 output can piped into <code>base64 --decode</code>
before dumping it to disk (console.logging the buffer would try to
decode the data as utf-8).</p>
<h3 id="http-server-to-explore-content">HTTP server to explore content</h3>
<p>At some point, to be able to explore annotations, it seemed to me that the CLI
was a bit limited to explore the content easily. I added a HTTP server
serving an index of the books and a book page showing the annotations. The
content is fetched from Amazon if it is not on disk, and it is then saved in
JSON format for later access.</p>
<p>I used fastify which is an alternative to express that promises to be much
faster. It worked well for my simple purposes.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<!-- The code is available here: TODO -->
<p>All in all, it was a really good experience, I learned about</p>
<ul>
<li>Man-in-the-middle in practice</li>
<li>Encryption</li>
<li>Binary decoding</li>
<li>String encodings</li>
</ul>
<p>There was a lot of hurdles but I was really pumped up by the fact that the
data recovered was important to me : I like reading and am now happy
that my highlights will live in a format that I will be able to read
in a long time for now. I am also happy to have them in a simple JSON text format
that I can query using tools I am familiar with <code>jq</code>, <code>rg</code> or <code>grep</code>.</p>
<p>Next plans:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>make a <a href="https://docs.cozy.io/en/tutorials/konnector/">Cozy connector</a> using the <code>whispersync-client</code> to have
my annotations automatically synced to my Cozy 🚀.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>see if it would make sense to have some kind of integration with Calibre</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The code is available here for education purposes: <a href="https://github.com/ptbrowne/whispersync-lib">whispersync-lib-code</a>.</p>
