      <description>My girlfriend graduated from her thesis last year üöÄüòç. With the help of many of her colleagues, we made her as PhD gift a custom board game, referencing at the good and challenging times of the thesis. There are some interesting bits here and there on its creation process that I wanted to share.
Collaborative board game The idea of this board game was simple. It is a turn by turn dice game where each player advances on a 65-squares path symbolizing the tortuous journey of a thesis.</description>

      <description>I am a big fan of my Kindle. This is the device I&amp;rsquo;d bring over to a desert island. I am also a fairly frequent user of the highlight feature where you can select a bit of text you like and save it. One thing is bothering me though: the lack of open API on the Kindle to retrieve the data about me. Amazon provides the my-clippings.txt file on the Kindle and the &amp;ldquo;Export my annotations via e-mail&amp;rdquo; feature, but both these features cannot be done in the background automatically, and the last read position is not available.</description>
